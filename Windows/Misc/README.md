# Windows 10 mouse beep on movement

> **Problem:** __Mouse beeps when you try to move it__

Have you just connected an XInput (Xbox 360/One controller) device?

Occasionally, when connecting an Xbox controller, you can end up with a cursor that moves slowly, and beeps while it does it. This can also happen when you have an application running that was using the controller, then exit to the desktop. Xinput drivers do not play nicely with mice.

> **Solution:** __Disconnect & reconnect Xbox controller__
